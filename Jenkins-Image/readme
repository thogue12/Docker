PART1:
 - Defining the pipeline
    - AGENT determines which OS or anything you would be using to run the pipeline
        - MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc
    - ENV Variables:
        - In order for this pipeline to work we have to establish some credentials
        - credentials from AWS, in order to access it's API and authenticate with our user.
            - USE: Access Key ID, Secrete Key ID
        - CREDENTIALS for github:
            - We also need to establish github credentials with the personal API

PART2:
 - STAGES:  
    - Pipelines are broken up into stages
    - stage:
        - Installs the most recent version of Terraform

    - stage2:
        - get the code from github
        - use the github api token
        - specify which branch
    
    -stage3:
        - Terraform init
    
    -stage4:
        - Terraform plan
